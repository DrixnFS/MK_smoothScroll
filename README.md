# MK_smoothScroll

Very easy and lightweight smooth **Scrolling** library. Works in every browser and also handles touch screens.

Mainly focused for one-page websites. Easily attach class *mk_scroller_block* to the elements you want to act as pages (when scrolled, scroll is going to them) and thats it.

In the head, *wheel-indicator* must come first then this library. No inicialization needed, it handles everything on its own.
